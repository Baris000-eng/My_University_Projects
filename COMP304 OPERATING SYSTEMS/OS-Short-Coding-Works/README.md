# OS-Short-Coding-Works
These are some short c implementations related to the usage of time functions, fork, execlp, and so on.

SC-1: usage of fork() and wait()

SC-2: usage of execlp for the command ps-f

SC-3: usage of sleep() and exit() function

SC-4: usage of the functions called strftime() , gettimeofday(), fork(), wait(), write() and read(). (Write() and read() are related to the interprocess communication logic with pipes.)
