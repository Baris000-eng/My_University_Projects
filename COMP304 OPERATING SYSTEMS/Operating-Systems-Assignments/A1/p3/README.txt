For problem 3:

Part-a
When we write the suitable makefile of the c source code which has a name p3a.c, we enable to compile the program called p3a.c using the make command in the command line.


Part-b
Similarly for p3b.c, when we write the suitable makefile of the c source code which has a name p3a.c, we enable to compile the program called p3a.c using the make command in the command line.
