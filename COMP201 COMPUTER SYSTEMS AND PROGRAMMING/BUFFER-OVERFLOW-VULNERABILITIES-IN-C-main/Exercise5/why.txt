The structs are the data types which have automatic safety for a single thread and also for the multiple threads. By using the struct data type, dealing with the threads is easier. Moreover, memory does not need to be allocated dynamically for the struct data types, and since the structs are value types, they do not need referencing. These are beneficial properties in terms of the increase in the performance of the program. What we mean by beneficial is to create a automatically thread-safe, fast-running, and value type environment . In addition to that, if we use the struct data type, we can access and remove it easily. This also decreases the time passes when we execute the program. Due to all of these properties of the struct data type, and the outcomes of these properties, using the stack data type changes the behavior of the program in constrast with not using it.
